Growth of crystals inside glass form a fascinating problem in material science. The growth of highly ordered crystal seeds inside a isotropic glassy medium introduces a lot of interesting. Experimentally, rotation of the crystal seed has 
been observed as the seed is grown under laser irradiation in variuos family of glasses. 

Here with atomistic simulations, we elucidate the nature of torque experienced by different regions of the seeded glass which may provide 
a better explanation to the experimentally observed rotation of crystal during laser induced crystal growth inside glass.
